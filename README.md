# Greenhouse Installs and Deliveries
This was a side project for my old job, as we had to input our customer's install and delivery logs on paper. There were many complaints about this system being paper so I strived to create a new system for employees to use online to input the install and delivery logs.
Automates any additional charges like exceeding mile radius and minimal charging amount to save employees extra time.
